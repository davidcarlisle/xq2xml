      <h1>Notes on XQuery to XML</h1>
      <h2>Version date: 20061026</h2>
      
      <p>XQ2XML currently uses the production names   reported by the parser
         as element names. Some of these begin with "XML", which isn't an error
         but these names are "reserved" so probably these element names should
         be changed.
      </p>
      
      <p>The parser catches some syntax errors but doesn't report the
         official error code, this makes it hard to build fully conforming
         systems that handle errors as well as valid input as specified.
      </p>
